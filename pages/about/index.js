      Im jp, the willy wonka of the open source factory. This is a bootcamp, but
      with all the feet in the mud. We learn by creating, and we document all of
      our process.
      <ul>
        IDEAS:
        <li>
          We structure work like this: Every monday we have a guided breathwork
          session on which we set the intention for that week.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each day we have 2 deep work sessions on which we gather as a team and
          work synchronously. This is all what takes. 4 hours daily. Consistency
          is what drives success.
        </li>
        <li>We use a particular set of tools. Not more, not less.</li>
        <li>
          We are inspired by the work of the team behind Visual Studio Code, and
          how they create the software that they ship
        </li>
        <li>
          The first iterations of this project will have little demand (it
          doesn't exist yet). My vision for its future is that it will bring a
          lot of people together
